# IxD-Nail

## Concept

Build a responsive wireframing tool for [Hammer for Mac](http://hammerformac.com/)
Build a lightweight responsive base for developing websites

### Principles

1. Ignore old browsers, you should charge extra for support older than IE9
1. Use minimal jQuery scripts, remember the [80-20 rule](http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/8020-rule/)
1. [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) (Keep It Simple Stupid)

## Used Tools
